# Quadrotor control

This repository contains implementations of three different control approaches for a quadrotor: PD Control, Sliding Mode Control, and Backstepping Control. They are described as follows:

- PD Control: A classical control approach that utilizes only proportional and derivative terms to generate the control signal.
- Sliding Mode Control: A robust control technique that aims to keep the system on a sliding surface.
- Backstepping Control: A control technique that utilizes the "inverse projection" method to design a control law in stages.

Each implementation is organized in a separate folder with its corresponding files in this repository. The code includes comments explaining some details.
